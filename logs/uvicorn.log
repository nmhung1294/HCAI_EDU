Mixture of Experts (MoE) is a neural network architecture that increases model capacity without proportionally increasing computation. It achieves this by activating only a subset of expert sub-networks for each input. The structure involves input, a router, selection of top-k experts, expert processing, and a weighted output.

Mixture of Experts (MoE) is a neural network architecture that increases model capacity without proportionally increasing computation. It activates only a subset of "expert" sub-networks for each input. Its structure involves input, a router, top-k experts selected, expert processing, and weighted output. The task involves optimizing the expert processing and output summing.

Mixture of Experts (MoE) là một kiến trúc mạng nơ-ron được thiết kế để tăng khả năng của mô hình mà không làm tăng tỷ lệ tính toán. Nó hoạt động bằng cách chỉ kích hoạt một tập hợp con các mạng con "chuyên gia" cho mỗi đầu vào, làm cho nó rất hiệu quả đối với các mô hình quy mô lớn như LLM (ví dụ: Mistral, DeepSeek). Cấu trúc của nó bao gồm: Đầu vào → Bộ định tuyến → Top-k Các chuyên gia được chọn → Xử lý chuyên gia → Đầu ra có trọng số.
